min-max-modular-svm is a powerful parallel SVM on parallel systems, such as super computer and clusters. It is designed to solve very large scale learning problems that could not be easily solved by traditional classifiers. More over, new version of min-max-modular svm can achieve high efficiency in incremental learning with minimum updating work. New features such as solving multi-label, hierarchical, and imbalanced learning problems will also be added soon.
